## Installation

Install directly from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/chesscom-opponent-risk-sc/oiemcgpbdohnhkplobgndgdhdlbafoeg).

## Development

### Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### Build extension
```bash
npm run build
```

### Run risk score tests
```bash
# Test specific username with debug output
npm run test-risk -- username --debug

npm run test-risk -- DrNykterstein --debug
```

## How It Works

The extension uses Chess.com's public API to gather:
- Win/Lose/Draw statistics across different time controls
- Recent game performance, including accuracies
- Account age and rating

For detailed information about the mathematical model and methodology, read the [Medium article](https://medium.com/@tim.sh/i-made-a-chrome-extension-to-help-avoid-playing-cheaters-in-chess-d61f75fb2e57).

## Technical Details

### v1.6.0-beta (2025-10-19)

#### Abort Counter & Cooldown Tracker

- **AbortTrackerService:** Smart abort monitoring system
  - Track all game aborts automatically
  - Rolling 1-hour window for abort counting
  - Limit detection (~10 aborts before cooldown)
  - 15-minute cooldown tracking
  - Abort history with opponent names and timestamps

- **Cooldown Prevention:** Proactive warnings to avoid lockout
  - Warning at 8/10 aborts used
  - Critical alert when limit reached
  - Real-time cooldown countdown timer
  - Browser notifications for warnings
  - "STOP PLAYING" alerts during cooldown

  - Progress bar showing aborts used
  - Live countdown during cooldown period
  - Recommendations based on current status
  - Abort history viewer
  - Reset function for testing
  - "Skip This Game" button (shows at high risk)

- **Smart Prevention Logic:**
  - Warns before you hit the limit
